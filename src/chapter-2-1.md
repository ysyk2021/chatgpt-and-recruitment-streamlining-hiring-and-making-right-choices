Definition of Recruitment
-------------------------

Recruitment is the process of identifying, attracting, and hiring qualified candidates for open positions within an organization. It involves several stages, including job analysis, sourcing candidates, screening resumes, interviewing candidates, and making a job offer.

Stages of Recruitment
---------------------

Recruitment can be broken down into several stages, including:

### 1. Job Analysis

The first stage of recruitment involves analyzing the job requirements and creating a job description that outlines the skills, experience, and qualifications required for the position.

### 2. Sourcing Candidates

Once the job description has been created, recruiters must identify potential candidates to fill the role. This can involve using job boards, social media, recruitment agencies, or internal referrals.

### 3. Resume Screening

After potential candidates have been identified, recruiters must review resumes and applications to determine which candidates meet the job requirements and are worth considering for further evaluation.

### 4. Interviewing Candidates

Candidates who have passed the initial screening stage are typically invited to an interview with the recruiter or hiring manager. Interviews may take place in person, over the phone, or via video conference.

### 5. Making a Job Offer

Finally, after the interviewing process is complete, the recruiter or hiring manager makes a job offer to the successful candidate, outlining the terms and conditions of employment.
