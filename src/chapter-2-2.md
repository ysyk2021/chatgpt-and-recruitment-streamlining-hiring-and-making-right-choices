Campus recruitment involves targeting students and recent graduates from universities and colleges to fill entry-level positions within the organization. This type of recruitment can be a strategic way to identify and attract top talent early in their careers and establish relationships with universities for future hiring needs.

Employee referral programs encourage current employees to refer qualified candidates for open positions within the organization. This type of recruitment can be an effective way to tap into the networks of current employees and can lead to higher employee retention rates and increased job satisfaction.
