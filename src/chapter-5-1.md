ChatGPT works by analyzing natural language inputs from candidates and generating human-like responses based on that input. It uses machine learning algorithms to understand the context of a conversation and provide relevant responses.

ChatGPT can be trained on specific datasets and programmed to recognize industry-specific terms and jargon. This allows it to provide more accurate and personalized responses to candidates.

ChatGPT can also analyze large amounts of data from candidate conversations to identify patterns and trends that can inform the recruitment process. This data can be used to optimize the recruitment process and improve the overall quality of hires.
